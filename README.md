# Finding the Best Portfolio Selection Method Using Dynamic Time Warping for K-Means Clustering and LSTM Neural Network Prediction of Indonesian Stock Prices
$\qquad$ This research investigates the integration of machine learning and clustering for stock price prediction and portfolio diversification, addressing the complexities posed by the Efficient Market Hypothesis and Modern Portfolio Theory. A dual-phased experimental framework compares two methodologies: predicting stock prices before clustering and clustering stocks before prediction. The study employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks for prediction, using both multi-output and recursive models, and K-Means clustering with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to assess stock movement similarities. Indonesian LQ45 stocks (2015â€“2023) form the dataset, with cluster representatives selected by Sharpe Ratio.

$\qquad$ Key findings indicate that clustering prior to prediction improves overall returns by capturing stock movement patterns, while the multi-output model achieves better accuracy than the recursive model. Portfolio C, based on clustering first and using the multi-output model, offers the best balance of risk and return, making it the optimal strategy. The results are compiled into a research paper and presented at [ICICIC 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gm_bY-N_cOHLyV2q1gLZrGaVPCxIYsBK/view?usp=sharing).
